By using loops Liquid is able to quickly generate the following dynamic index in just 4 lines of code.

{% highlight html %}
	{% for post in site.posts%}
		<a href="{{post.url}}">{{post.title}}</a>
		<br/><hr>
	{% endfor %}
{% endhighlight%}

Each time a new post is added to the `_posts` folder it will automatically be added to the list about, without any need for updating the site code.
