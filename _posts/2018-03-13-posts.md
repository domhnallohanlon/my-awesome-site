Jekyll is designed to be, among other things, a tool to help you blog. Once you've got everything set up creating a new post, or blog post is easy. Simply create a new HTML or MD file it the `_posts` directory and it will be added to your blog.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
