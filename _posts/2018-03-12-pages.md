For more traditional, "customer-facing" pages like  About Us, Contact Form, Store etc. you can use Jekyll **pages**. 

Bear in mind that when you build your Jekyll site the root directroy essentially is the `_pages` driectory, so if you're setting up a collection for this then consider using a more idiosyncratic name such as `_my-pages` or something similar.

A page is typically the sort of thing that will appear in your navigation bar, something that you want the visitior to have quick access to.
