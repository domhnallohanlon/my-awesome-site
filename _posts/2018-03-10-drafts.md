As the name implies, `_drafts` are for work in progress. They are saved with your site but not visible on your website.

You might need to add a `_drafts` directory to your site if one does not exist already. The drafts folder is also a handy place to keep templates for different types of documents. When you want to create a new post simply open your template and do a "save as" to add the new post to your `_layouts` directory.
