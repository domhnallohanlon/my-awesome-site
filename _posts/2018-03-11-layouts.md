Layout files are HTML files that act like templates for your content. The most powerful thing about using layouts is that the allow for the separation of structure (i.e. navigation) and content (i.e. links, alt text).

In the basic example there are layouts for posts and pages, but there's nothing to stop you adding in layouts for a gallery, store listings, videos, forms, tutorials, etc.

To apply a layout to a given document simply specify the layout in the *yaml* front matter at the top of you document.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
layout: post
---
{% endhighlight%}

The starter theme - minima - contains four layouts:

 - default
 - page
 - post
 - home 

To add more layouts to your site you must create a new layout in the `_layouts` directory. If this directory doesn't exist - as is the case with the minima theme - you must create it first.
